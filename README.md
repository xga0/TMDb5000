# tmdb5000
For the first part of this project, we present a movie recommendation system based on cosine similarity. Then, we conducted multiple algorithms to train a model to predict the box office of a movie with giving features.

We used 4 datasets in total in this project. For the first part, we used the TMDb 5000 datasets from Kaggle. The datasets have 2 subsets: TMDb 5000 Movies and TMDb 5000 Credits. TMDb 5000 Movies has 4804 observations and 20 variables, including id, budget, genres, keywords, etc. There are four variables, movie_id, title, cast, and crew, in the TMDb 5000 Credits with 4814
observations. Similar as IMDb, The Movie Database (TMDb) is a popular, user editable database for movies and TV shows. Since 2008, with over 200,000 developers and companies using their platform, TMDb has become a premiere source for metadata. In order to prepare the dataset for second part, we combined 3 extra datasets: IMDb 5000 Movie Dataset, The Most Popular
Actors, and The Most Popular Actresses. From 27 variables in IMDb 5000 Movie Dataset, we mainly used director_name and imdb_score. Moreover, we used top 300 names in both The Most Popular Actors and The Most Popular Actresses.
